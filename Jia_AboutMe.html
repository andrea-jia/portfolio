             Hello! I'm Andrea Jia, and I am currently a freshman at Dublin 
             High School. I am interested in the field of biology, and I am 
             considering a biomedical career in the future. To reach my goals,
             I am planning on participating in the Physics, Chemistry, and 
             Biology Olympiads, which will allow me to extend my knowledge of 
             the subjects I am interested in. I am also taking CSP to broaden
             my knowledge of technology, as every career in this generation 
             usually involves an aspect of technology, and coding is a useful
             skill needed to contribute the most I can to any future job. 
             Additionally, I will be applying for the COSMOS program provided
             by the California State University, which will allow for further
             enrichment in the field of biology. To me, the study of life and
             the microscopic components that make that possible are extremely
             interesting, and has space for contribution. There are many 
             possibilities in the scientific fields, and biology happens to 
             attract my interest the most. 
             <br><br> 
             I am a person who values organization, and I tend to keep my 
             workspace as neat as it can be. One of my hobbies is art, so I 
             am also an artistic person. This helps in organization as well
             as other aspects in future careers. Through my experiences, I've 
             learned that I am also diligent in my work, and that I make sure
             everything I do is the best it can be. When working with others,
             I am cooperative in that I listen to what they have to say, and
             I am open to the the ideas that they have to share. 
             <br><br>
             In middle school, I held Principal's Honor Roll for three years,
             and participated in Speech and Debate. In high school, I joined
             numerous clubs, including both academic and volunteer clubs. For
             example, I have joined the Biology Olympiad Club in order to
             further develop my interest in biology and to better prepare for
             the test. I also participated in activities like can food 
             collection and medical supply sorting for community service. 
            </p>

                 Throughout the course of high school, I hope to extend my skills
                 by experiencing different things and to get a more specific idea 
                 of what aspect of biology I am most interested in. For now, 
                 thank you for taking the time to read about who I am, and I 
                 encourage you take a look at the rest of my online portfolio!
