                <p class="col-sm-8" >Why hello there ^-^ <br> I'm Andrea Jia, and I am currently a freshman at 
                 Dublin High School. I am interested in the field of biology, and I am considering a biomedical 
                 career in the future. To reach my goals, I am currently taking CSP to enhance my knowledge of 
                 technology, as every career in this generation usually involves an aspect of technology, and it 
                 will be helpful for me to understand how to code to contribute to my future job. I am also 
                 planning on participating in the Chemistry and Biology Olympiad, which will allow me to learn more 
                 knowledge in subjects I am interested in. To me, the study of life and the molecules that make that 
                 possible is extremely interesting, and has space for contribution. There are many possibilities in 
                 the scientific fields, and biology happens to attract my interest the most.</p>
                <br>
                <p> 
                 <br>

                 <br> 
                 My important achievements: etc etc</p>

Common Mistakes to Avoid
Principal’s Honor Roll (caps and “pal”) 
Club names are capitalized along with offices/positions held in the club (ex. Dublin High School Animal Club).  Write out acronyms. 
Do not use “hard-working”!!!  Be more specific by using the skills list 
Everyday and throughout are one word
high school is not capitalized but Dublin High School is
Capitalize a profession ONLY when referred to by the complete title, (ex. Registered Nurse instead OR nurse; Culinary Arts Instructor OR teacher)
Capitalize official college degrees when spelled out (ex. Bachelor of Fine Arts but not bachelor’s degree)
A bachelor’s degree or master’s degree is acceptable in any reference (ex. She earned her master’s degree in two years.)
Capitalize a major when it appears as part of the degree.  Lowercase major when it follows the word degree (ex. Bachelor of Science in Computer Science or She holds a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science).
All abbreviations for degrees should be written without periods (ex. BS, MA, MBA)
Do not capitalize school or college studies, fields of study, options, major subjects, except languages, unless a specific course if being referred to (ex. He is studying philosophy and English, Each student must meet core requirements in biological sciences and liberal arts, Colleges offer a curriculum in graphic arts
