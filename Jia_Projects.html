                 <em>Course: Computer Science Principles</em><br>

                 This project used the coding program Scratch to
                 create a game of our own choosing. I completed 
                 it with a partner in my class, and we decided to
                 make a shooting game involving an octopus sprite
                 and a shark sprite that Sprite provided. My main 
                 role was coding the actual game, while my partner
                 helped with tracking our progress in our
                 <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17WIL5w1fi7COYFPEcPP-3ogCyavx3o9uXD6zXAkK0f4/edit?usp=sharing"
                 target="_blank"> Design Notebook</a> (Scratch 
                 does not allow multiple contributors).
                 I learned many things, like how to organize my 
                 code well and how to better communicate
                 with my partner.This project was the first time
                 I started using comments in my code, which 
                 improved my organization as well as teamwork so
                 I could use the comments to better explain the 
                 code that I created. Some challenges I faced 
                 were learning the code and communicating with my
                 partner, as I had little coding experience and 
                 even less experience working on code with a 
                 partner. Scratch was a project where it was hard
                 to communicate because of the inability of my 
                 partner to work on the same code as I was. We 
                 overcame this by utilizing the time we had in 
                 class to the best of our ability, and prioritizing 
                 our tasks by what we could do at home and what 
                 we needed to do together.

                 <em>Course: Computer Science Principles</em><br>
                 <em>Time: September 2018 - October 2018</em><br>
                 This project involved the coding program MIT App
                 Inventor, which provided tutorials of game codes
                 that users could use to make their own apps. I 
                 worked with a partner to complete a tutorial and
                 modify the code to make it our own game. Our game
                 happened to be a states geography quiz, where 
                 players were quizzed on the East Coast states, 
                 their capitals, and their state flowers. In this
                 project, since I coded in the previous Scratch 
                 project (mentioned above), my role this time was 
                 mainly organizing and maintaining our 
                 <a target="_blank" 
                 href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLAD4WEtMIKJnWLWkNaCaHy9354jdYHYcOxQeIl0GT4/edit?usp=sharing">
                 Design Notebook</a>. However, my partner was 
                 absent for many days during this project, 
                 and with there being a deadline for an in-class 
                 project, I also completed some of the code as 
                 well. I learned how to be more flexible and how 
                 to troubleshoot code, which were necessary skills
                 I needed to overcome the challenges I faced in 
                 this project. Due to the game tutorial of our 
                 choice being new and a few misspellings, my 
                 partner and I found many errors when we tried to
                 run the code. Troubleshooting required we analyze
                 the code line by line, and also completely 
                 understand how it worked to understand why it 
                 wasn't working. This project was much more 
                 challenging than the Scratch project, which 
                 allowed me to gain skills I didn't have before.
                 For teamwork, I was able to help my partner while
                 she was coding by giving her guidance, and I also
                 learned how communicate my ideas more than I did 
                 during the Scratch Project.
