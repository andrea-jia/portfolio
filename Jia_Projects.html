                                 Course: Computer Science Principles<br>
                                 Time: August 2018 - September 2018<br>
                                 This project used the coding program Scratch to create a game of our own choosing. 
                                 I completed it with a partner in my class, and we decided to make a shooting game 
                                 involving an octopus sprite and a shark sprite that Sprite provided. My role was 
                                 mainly coding the actual game, while my partner helped with tracking our progress 
                                 in an online notebook (Scratch does not allow multiple contributors). I learned many
                                 things, like how to organize my code well and better communication with my partner.
                                 This project was the first time I started using comments in my code, which improved my 
                                 organization as well as teamwork so I could use the comments to better explain the 
                                 code that I created. Some challenges I faced were learning the code and communicating
                                 with my partner, as I had little coding experience and even less experience working on 
                                 code with a partner. Scratch was a project where it was hard to communicate because of
                                 the inability of my partner to work on the same code as I was. We overcame this by 
                                 utilizing the time we had in class to the best of our ability, and prioritizing our 
                                 tasks by what we could do at home and what we needed to do together.

                                 Course: Computer Science Principles<br>
                                 Time: September 2018 - October 2018<br>
                                 This project involved the coding program MIT App Inventor, which provided tutorials of 
                                 game codes that users could use to make their own apps. I worked with a partner to 
                                 complete a tutorial and modify the code to make it our own game. Our game happened to 
                                 be a states geography quiz, where players were quizzed on the East Coast states, their 
                                 capitals, and their state flowers. In this project, since I coded in my last project 
                                 (the Scratch project above), my role this time was mainly organizing and maintaining our
                                 Engineering Notebook. However, my partner was absent for many days during this project, 
                                 and with there being a deadline for an in-class project, I also completed some of the 
                                 code as well. I learned how to be more flexible and how to troubleshoot code, which were 
                                 necessary skills I needed to overcome the challenges I faced in this project. Due to the
                                 game tutorial of our choice being new and a few misspellings, my partner and I found many 
                                 errors when we tried to run the code. Troubleshooting required we analyze the code line by 
                                 line, and also completely understand how it worked to understand why it wasn't working. This
                                 project was much more challenging than the Scratch project, which allowed me to gain skills 
                                 I didn't have before. For teamwork, I was able to help my partner while she was coding by 
                                 giving her guidance, and I also learned how to reach out more than I did during the Scratch
                                 Project.
